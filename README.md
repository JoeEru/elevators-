# internship coding challenge

 ## About :
 The objective is to write a program that will identify which
 elevator will be served once a request for an elevator is registered.

 ## Rules :  
 - An elevator is requested by default from <b>top</b> floor.
 - An elevator can be resting at a given floor, going up or going down.
 - An elevator switch automatically his direction when reaching the edges of the building (means the first and top floors). </br>
 - An elevator can not switch his direction in the middle of a building.
>Example: 
 in a building of 10 floors, an elevator at the 3rd floor and
 ascending can never go down before reaching the 10th floor. And vice
 versa.
 - An elevator is never in between floors.
